<h1>Ticketing Systems Lab</h1>

<p>
  This repository contains my hands‑on help desk lab work, where I simulate real IT support scenarios
  using the cloud help desk system Spiceworks, Jira, and more to come. For the purposes of this lab, I created each ticket on
  behalf of the user and worked through them as if they were submitted in a real environment.

  I am in the process of learning SOPs for Tier 1 Technicians handling tickets and how ticketing systems are used in real environments to better prepare myself to be a Help Desk Technician. As a part of this lab I'm actively building a simulated MSP service desk built in Jira Service Management, featuring realistic SLAs, queue structures, technician workflows, escalation procedures, and operational SOPs.
  
</p>

<p>Each ticket includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original issue</li>
  <li>My triage and decision‑making</li>
  <li>Internal notes</li>
  <li>Public responses</li>
  <li>Troubleshooting steps</li>
  <li>Final resolution summaries</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical help desk workflows, troubleshooting,
  communication skills, and realistic ticket handling from start to finish.
</p>

<p>More tickets and documentation will be added as I continue building out the lab.</p>
