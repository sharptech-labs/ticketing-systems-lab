# Introduction

Here is the portal that users would submit their ticket from in Spiceworks:

For the purposes of this lab, I have created the tickets from the cloud help desk on the user's behalf.

On this ticket I'm making, we can pretend that Dima approached me and complained of a slow computer, so I would go ahead and just make a ticket on his behalf, (in an internal IT environment, not realistic for MSP environments).

As a Tier 1 technician, I would review every new ticket to classify the issue, verify or adjust the priority, and determine whether it falls within Tier 1 scope or requires escalation. I then accept ownership, document my initial assessment in an internal note, and begin either troubleshooting or routing the ticket appropriately.

I have accepted all tickets for the purpose of this lab, and will begin to work through them now.
