# Introduction

Here is the portal that users would submit their ticket from:

For the purposes of this lab, I have created the tickets from the cloud help desk on the user's behalf.

On this ticket I'm making, we can pretend that Dima approached me and complained of a slow computer, so I would go ahead and just make a ticket on his behalf, (in an internal IT environment, not realistic for MSP environments).

I would carefully examine each ticket and ask myself if it's something I can handle, or if I need to escalate it. I would then determine the priority of this ticket and set it if it needs to be changed, then accept it, adding an internal note of my acceptance.

I have accepted all tickets for the purpose of this lab, and will begin to work through them now.
