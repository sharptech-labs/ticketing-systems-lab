<h1>Ticket 3 — Alexey: Locked Out of Windows</h1>

<p>
  The next ticket is from Alexey — he can't log into Windows now.
</p>

<p>
  I've decided I can handle this ticket and can get his account unlocked, which is the likely cause here. I'll make an internal note.

<p>
  Now I'll write a public response to him letting him know I'm checking into the issue.

</p>

<p>
  Now I will open Active Directory Users and Computers and check the status of his account. I confirm it is locked. I right‑click his name, select Account, and click Unlock account. I will create a temporary password for him and make sure the box is checked for User must change password at next logon so he can make his own new one.

<p>
  I'll make an internal note now.

<p>
  Now I will request to give Alexey a call to give him his temporary password securely.

<p>
  He accepted. I called him, verified his identity, and gave him his temporary password. He enters it, Windows prompts him to make a new one, he does, and successfully logs in.
</p>

<p>
  I'll make an internal note.

<h3>Resolution Summary</h3>

<p>
