<h1>Ticket 4 — Roman: Wi‑Fi Dropping Every Few Minutes</h1>

<p>
  Here's another ticket from Roman. He reports his Wi‑Fi on his laptop is dropping and reconnecting automatically. I'll help him get this resolved. Making an internal note that I'm accepting the ticket.

  I call Roman and start to ask some clarifying questions like: since when was this happening? Does it only happen at work or at home too on this laptop? How long does it stay connected before disconnecting?
</p>

<p>
  He makes a point that it happens both at home and at the office. I'll make an internal note.

<p>
  He also says that it only stays connected for a few minutes and then stops. I'm going to walk him through some guided troubleshooting steps smoothly over the phone now.
</p>

<p>
  I tell him to simply restart it first. That didn’t work, so I guide him through resetting the Wi‑Fi adapter. That didn’t work either. So next, I guide him through checking if the network adapter is up to date. An update was available, I had him update it, and I confirmed it updated to the latest version afterwards. I was making internal notes during all of this.

<p>
  After this, he stated that the connection was stable and not dropping.
</p>

<p>
  I'll make a public reply, write a resolution summary, and close this ticket.
