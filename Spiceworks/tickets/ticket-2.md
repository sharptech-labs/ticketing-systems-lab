<h1>Ticket 2 — Roman: Teams Crashing</h1>

<p>
  Let's move onto the next ticket. I would examine the priority of the tickets and urgency to determine which to choose.
</p>

<p>
  Here is a ticket from Roman.
</p>

<p>
  I've examined it and determined I can handle it, and that it is a higher priority ticket. I'll get started on this now. First I'll make an internal note and let Roman know I'm going to look into the issue.

<p>
  To begin troubleshooting, I'm going to see what version of Teams he is using by asking him quickly if he can check the version for me.

  He replies back that he is unable to navigate to that. I write him asking if we can call on the phone to get the problem resolved quickly.

  We call and I explain the steps to take. I determine he is running an outdated version of Teams. So I quickly remote into his PC and uninstall it by going to Settings → Apps → search for Teams, and uninstall the old version. Then I download the latest Teams installer, install it, launch it, and have him log in. I'll confirm connectivity by having him join a test meeting.
</p>

<p>
  Roman confirmed the test Teams meeting was uninterrupted and worked fine. I will make an internal note about the resolution of the issue.

<h3>Resolution Summary</h3>

<p>
  Issue resolved. Teams was crashing due to an outdated version of the application. Guided the user over the phone to check the version — it was outdated. So I remoted into his computer, uninstalled the old version, and installed the latest Teams build. User confirmed successful meeting connection with no further crashes.
